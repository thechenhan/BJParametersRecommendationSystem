# BJParametersRecommendationSystem
This is a matlab app built based on BP-NN learning algorithm. It can recommend the optimal build parameters for binder jetting (a kind of 3D printer) machine and give out the estimated time and material consumption as well as certain Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

##Introduction
Do you know 3D printer？ Have you ever used it? You may know that there are a lot of parameters should be set before printing. It's sometimes thicky because the parameters always affect the end-product propertres. This app helps user to choose the optimal setting parameters and evaluate the production cost and efficiency.

##How it works?
Load the STL file, adjust the wanted part quality according to the needs, click recommendation button. The recommendation parameters and estimated quality performance will be shown. With this premiere parameters, set up the production system parameters,  either using the default value retrieved from the recommendation or customized value. The calculation will give the estimation of time and material consumption as well as the production performance(KPIs).
